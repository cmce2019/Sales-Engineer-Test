# Sales-Engineer-Test

For the test I used Postman to built all the payment flow. In the next part of this document, we can se all points of the test. Also we can found the .json file, where is the source code of the queries built previously. 



## Payment flow:
in all steps I used POST HTTP verb

## Technical definitions:
- Tokenization: This represents the Payment Method selected by the customer to pay
- Authorize: An Authorization represents a hold on funds in the customer's account. This is the first half of the two-step payment flow.
- Capture: This is the second half of the two-step payment flow. For a full capture, leave the amount empty.
- Charge: A Charge is a one-step payment flow that transfers funds from the customer's account.
- Void: A void cancels an operation before it has been finalized.
- Refound: A refund allows you to cancel or undo a sale and return the charged amount to the customer.
## Conclusion:
I think that it was a interesant exercise, I had some troubles with the payment authorization, but I would like that exists more examples in the use of the API
